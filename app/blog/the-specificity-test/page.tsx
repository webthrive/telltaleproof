          <p style={p}>If someone handed me a piece of writing and asked me to tell them whether it was AI-generated without using any detection tool, the first thing I&apos;d do is look for specificity. Not keywords. Not sentence length. Not hedging language, though that&apos;s useful too. Specificity — or more precisely, its absence.</p>

          <p style={p}>Here&apos;s the thing about AI writing: it&apos;s rarely wrong. It&apos;s comprehensive and accurate and covers the topic from multiple reasonable angles. But it&apos;s almost entirely generic, and that genericness has a particular texture that I&apos;ve gotten very good at recognizing. The examples are too perfect. The anecdotes are too illustrative. The numbers are either absent or suspiciously round.</p>

          <p style={p}>The reason is structural. A language model generates text by predicting what comes next based on patterns in its training data. When it needs an example to support a claim, it reaches for the most statistically representative example — the one that best fits the pattern of &quot;example that supports this type of claim.&quot; That&apos;s exactly the opposite of how a human writer reaches for an example, which is: what do I actually remember about this? What happened to me, or to someone I know, or in a case I read closely?</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Why illustrative clarity is a red flag</h2>

          <p style={p}>The clearest marker of AI-generated examples is what I call illustrative clarity — the example fits the point being made so perfectly that it couldn&apos;t have been drawn from actual experience. Real memories don&apos;t do this. Real experiences are messy. The outcome was more complicated than the lesson. The detail that sticks in your memory is the one that doesn&apos;t quite serve the argument you&apos;re making.</p>

          <p style={p}>Consider two versions of the same example. The first: &quot;A content team I worked with implemented an AI review process and saw their quality scores improve significantly over the following quarter.&quot; That&apos;s illustrative clarity. It happened, it worked, it proved the point. The second: &quot;There was a content team I worked with — B2B SaaS, they were running maybe 12 articles a month — who added a human review step specifically for behavioral signals. Two months later the quality metrics were up. But they also slowed down their publishing cadence, which created its own set of arguments internally, and I&apos;m honestly not sure they would have made the same call if they&apos;d known that going in.&quot;</p>

          <p style={p}>The second version is harder to read. The lesson is less clean. There&apos;s tension that doesn&apos;t resolve. That&apos;s because it&apos;s drawn from memory rather than constructed to illustrate a point — and that distinction is detectable, both by human readers and by the behavioral signals that AI detection tools measure.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>The anatomy of authentic specificity</h2>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Numbers that are oddly precise</h3>

          <p style={p}>Human writers tend to remember the actual number, not the rounded version. &quot;We were running at 23% open rates when we switched to the new subject line strategy&quot; rather than &quot;email open rates in this range.&quot; The odd precision is a signal of actual measurement — someone ran the report, saw the number, and remembered it.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI often goes one of two ways: either vague quantification (&quot;significantly improved,&quot; &quot;a substantial portion&quot;) or suspiciously round numbers (&quot;70% of marketers report...&quot;) that usually can&apos;t be sourced. Both patterns register differently than the idiosyncratic precision of a real data point someone actually looked at.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Details that don&apos;t fully serve the argument</h3>

          <p style={p}>This is the one I notice most in strong human writing. There&apos;s always some detail that&apos;s included not because it supports the argument but because it&apos;s true, and the writer can&apos;t help including it. A caveat that complicates the takeaway. A follow-up thought that slightly undermines the previous claim. An aside that&apos;s interesting but not relevant.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI writing doesn&apos;t do this. Every detail earns its place by supporting the point. The structure is efficient in a way that human thinking isn&apos;t. I&apos;ve started calling this &quot;argumentative completeness&quot; — when every element of the piece fits together too neatly, it&apos;s a signal that the content was generated rather than remembered.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Named sources and specific attribution</h3>

          <p style={p}>Real research produces named citations. &quot;A 2024 Stanford study led by Percy Liang found that...&quot; rather than &quot;research suggests that...&quot; The specific attribution is possible only if someone actually looked up the study rather than pattern-matched from training data about what studies in this area typically find.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI models have a strong tendency to cite the shape of evidence (&quot;studies show,&quot; &quot;research indicates&quot;) without being able to provide the actual evidence, because they&apos;re drawing on patterns of how claims are supported in their training data rather than actual recall of specific sources. When a piece includes attributable, linkable citations, it&apos;s a strong signal of genuine research — or at minimum, of editorial work to verify and attribute claims.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Generic specificity — the fake precision problem</h2>

          <p style={p}>There&apos;s a failure mode worth naming separately: content that appears specific but isn&apos;t. Statistics without sources. Quotes that can&apos;t be verified. Case studies described vaguely enough that they could apply to any company in any industry.</p>

          <p style={p}>This kind of generic specificity is often worse than acknowledged vagueness, because it implies sourcing that doesn&apos;t exist. Content Trace weights authentic specificity partly by checking whether specific-seeming claims have the structural markers of real attribution — not just the presence of a number, but whether the number is the kind that could actually be sourced. An unverifiable stat from an uncited source registers differently than a precise data point with clean attribution, even if both appear specific on the surface.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Using the specificity test on your own content</h2>

          <p style={p}>The useful thing about understanding this signal is that it works as an editing tool, not just a detection tool. When you&apos;re reviewing AI-generated content before publishing, the specificity test is a quick way to identify where the work is: wherever the examples are too clean, wherever the numbers are round or sourced to &quot;industry data,&quot; wherever the case study could describe any company — that&apos;s where you need to add something real.</p>

          <p style={p}>The additions don&apos;t have to be dramatic. A specific date. A named source. A complicating detail from something you actually remember. The claim that a particular approach &quot;didn&apos;t work as expected at first.&quot; These small intrusions of actual experience are what move behavioral detection scores — and they&apos;re also what make content worth reading.</p>

          <p style={p}>There&apos;s something almost elegant about that alignment. The things that make content feel human to a reader are the same things that make it score lower on detection. Which suggests that the best use of AI detection isn&apos;t catching other people&apos;s content — it&apos;s understanding what your own content is missing.</p>
