          <h2 style={h2s}>1. Opinion uniformity — the most reliable tell</h2>

          <p style={p}>Human writers don't hold perfectly stable positions from the first sentence to the last. They make a claim, then soften it. Take a strong side, encounter the counterargument mid-piece, adjust. Sometimes end up somewhere meaningfully different from where they started. That drift isn't sloppiness — it's evidence of actually thinking through a problem while writing.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI text doesn't do this. It picks a position in response to the prompt and maintains it, uniformly, across the entire piece. The introduction, body, and conclusion pull in exactly the same direction with equal conviction. Every counterargument is resolved neatly in favor of the thesis. The position never genuinely wobbles — because the model isn't deliberating. It picked a thesis and executed on it.</p>

          <p style={p}>This is the most reliable behavioral signal I know of. When every section aligns perfectly and no part of the argument creates real tension, that uniformity is suspicious.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>2. Reflexive hedging</h2>

          <p style={p}>There's a specific hedging pattern that's almost exclusively an AI behavior: the reflexive qualifier dropped in before even uncontroversial claims. "It's worth noting that," "It's important to consider," "It should be mentioned that." These appear because language models learned that academic and professional writing softens claims this way — and they apply it broadly, even when the claim being hedged is completely obvious.</p>

          <p style={p}>Humans hedge strategically. We qualify when we're genuinely uncertain, or when we're acknowledging a legitimate competing view, or when we're about to say something that might be controversial. We don't hedge before stating that consistency matters in branding.</p>

          <p style={p}>The ratio of hedged claims to direct claims is one of the cleaner statistical proxies for AI writing — and it's one that paraphrasing tools don't typically address.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>3. Constructed specifics</h2>

          <p style={p}>AI examples are too well-chosen. When a language model needs to illustrate a point, it reaches for a scenario that fits cleanly and perfectly. The example has no rough edges. It doesn't extend beyond the point it's illustrating. It doesn't drag in adjacent complications or context that doesn't serve the argument. It's optimized for clarity at the cost of authenticity.</p>

          <p style={p}>Real examples are messier. You pick something from memory and it's slightly imperfect for your purposes — it illustrates the main point but has a wrinkle you have to acknowledge. "This is roughly what I mean, though the situation was more complicated because..." That complication is evidence of real memory. Constructed examples don't have wrinkles because they weren't remembered. They were built to order.</p>

          </div>

          <h2 style={h2s}>4. No self-correction</h2>

          <p style={p}>Human writers catch themselves mid-thought. "Actually, that's not quite right —" or "Let me walk that back a bit." These in-text corrections appear because humans write in real time, often discovering what they think in the process. The first formulation of an idea frequently isn't quite right, and a writer working through a problem will revise it on the page rather than only in their head.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI text doesn't self-correct because the model isn't discovering anything. It's generating text based on probability distributions. There's nothing to correct because there was no initial formulation to be wrong about — the text comes out polished and final-sounding because it was never drafted. It was predicted.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>5. Delivery structure vs. discovery structure</h2>

          <p style={p}>Two ways to structure an argument. Delivery: you know the point, you know the evidence, you lay it out in logical order. Discovery: you start with a question, work through it, and the structure emerges from figuring out the answer.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI text almost always has delivery structure. The introduction tells you exactly what's coming, the body delivers it in labeled sections, the conclusion summarizes. This isn't inherently problematic — plenty of legitimate writing uses delivery structure. But when combined with other signals, it's a behavioral fingerprint. Human writing that's genuinely working through a problem tends to feel like it's figuring something out, not presenting pre-packaged findings. There's a qualitative difference that's hard to name but easy to feel once you know to look for it.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h2 style={h2s}>6. Tonal uniformity</h2>

          <p style={p}>AI writing is tonally consistent in a way that's subtly inhuman. The register doesn't shift. The level of formality holds constant from the first paragraph to the last. There are no moments where the writer steps outside the mode they're in to say something more directly, or more bluntly, or more warmly than the surrounding context calls for.</p>

          <p style={p}>Human writing has tonal variation even within a single piece. A professional blog post might drop into a more personal register for one paragraph, or punch harder on a point the writer cares about, or pick up a trace of sarcasm when something strikes them as absurd. That variation isn't inconsistency — it's evidence of a real person behind the text, with actual reactions that don't perfectly follow genre conventions.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>7. No real perspective</h2>

          <p style={p}>This one is harder to articulate, but I think it's the deepest tell. Real writing has a perspective embedded in it — specific knowledge, specific experience, specific stakes that shape what gets said and how. Someone writing about AI detection has actually used these tools, has been frustrated by specific false positives, has opinions about which vendors are overselling their capabilities. That grounding shows up in the writing even when it isn't stated explicitly.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI writing about the same topic covers the subject matter correctly but doesn't hold a perspective on it. It knows the positions that exist; it doesn't occupy one. The result is writing that's comprehensive and balanced in a way that genuine expertise rarely is. Real subject matter knowledge comes with opinions, preferences, and sometimes blind spots. The absence of those things is its own tell.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>8. Perfect counterargument balance</h2>

          <p style={p}>Related to opinion uniformity, but worth separating: AI text presents counterarguments with suspicious evenhandedness. Every point gets a counterpoint. Every counterpoint is resolved with matching weight. The argument feels fair and balanced — not because the writer wrestled with competing views, but because the model distributes probability across positions evenly.</p>

          <p style={p}>Humans who hold actual positions don't write this way. They engage seriously with the counterarguments they find genuinely compelling and wave off the ones they don't. Their rebuttals are more vigorous in some places than others. Their concessions are real concessions. The asymmetry in how they handle different objections tells you something about what they actually think. That asymmetry is absent from AI text almost entirely.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>How these signals work in combination</h2>

          <p style={p}>None of these signals is definitive on its own. A highly structured human writer — an academic, a lawyer, a technical writer — might score poorly on delivery vs. discovery, tonal uniformity, and reflexive hedging, all while writing completely original work. The value is in the combination.</p>

          <p style={p}>When a piece of text shows all eight patterns simultaneously, the probability that it represents authentic human writing drops substantially. And crucially — these patterns don't respond to paraphrasing tools or synonym-swapping. You can shuffle the vocabulary around a hollow argument and the argument stays hollow. The behavioral fingerprint is in the architecture of the reasoning, not in the specific words used to express it.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Frequently asked questions</h2>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Can these behavioral signals be faked with the right prompt?</h3>
          <p style={p}>Partially. You can prompt a model to introduce self-corrections or shift position mid-argument — and it'll do it. The problem is that prompted opinion drift tends to be formulaic, appearing in the same structural position with the same rhetorical move. Real human cognitive patterns are irregular and contextual in ways that AI-generated approximations aren't. The simulation is detectable.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Do structured writers like academics score poorly on these signals?</h3>
          <p style={p}>Some do, on certain signals — particularly delivery structure and tonal uniformity. This is why good detectors weight categories independently rather than treating any single signal as definitive. An academic writer may score high on delivery structure but score clearly human on specificity, perspective, and non-uniform opinion. The combination tells the real story.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Which signal is hardest to fake?</h3>
          <p style={p}>Authentic specific memory. Real examples always carry a small amount of contextual imperfection — details that don't quite serve the argument, complications that have to be acknowledged. AI examples don't have that messiness because they weren't remembered; they were constructed. That imperfection is very hard to simulate convincingly because it requires actually having the memory to be imperfect about.</p>
