          <h2 style={h2s}>Writing is a record of thinking, not just a container for information</h2>

          <p style={p}>When a person writes, they're not just transferring information from their head to the page. They're thinking on the page. The act of writing changes what they think. Sentences get abandoned mid-way because a better formulation appeared. Paragraphs end somewhere different from where they started because the argument evolved while they were making it.</p>

          <p style={p}>None of that happens with AI. The model doesn't think while it writes - it generates. The conclusion is implicit in the prompt before the first word is produced. What looks like reasoning is pattern completion. The structure of genuine thought - tentative, self-correcting, occasionally surprised by its own conclusions - is absent. Not weakened. Absent.</p>

          <p style={p}>This is why AI writing can be technically perfect and still feel hollow. It's not missing information. It's missing evidence of a mind at work.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>The hedging problem is worse than people realize</h2>

          <p style={p}>If I had to pick one single signal that most reliably flags AI text in my experience, it's reflexive hedging. "It's important to note." "It's worth considering." "There are several factors at play here." "This is a complex topic with many dimensions."</p>

          <p style={p}>Humans hedge too - but strategically, when we're genuinely uncertain about something. AI hedges constantly, regardless of whether uncertainty is warranted, because hedging was rewarded during training. It signals carefulness without actually being careful. The result is writing that qualifies everything and commits to nothing, which readers experience as evasive even when they can't say why.</p>

          <p style={p}>I've started doing a quick ctrl+F for "it's worth" when editing AI-assisted content. The count is usually embarrassing. Four or five instances in a thousand-word piece isn't a stylistic quirk - it's a tell.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Rhythm gives it away faster than vocabulary</h2>

          <p style={p}>Read a paragraph of AI text aloud. Then read something from a writer you love. The difference in rhythm is usually immediate - you don't need to analyze it, you feel it in your mouth.</p>

          <p style={p}>Human writers vary sentence length dramatically. A short sentence lands. Then something longer unfolds, carrying the reader through a more complex idea at a pace that matches the complexity. Then another short one, to reset. This variation isn't usually intentional - it's what happens when you're writing the way you think, which has natural bursts and pauses built in.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI text is metronomic. Sentences cluster around a similar length. Paragraphs are similar sizes. The cadence is even and consistent in a way that real thought never is. Linguists sometimes call this burstiness - human writing is bursty, AI writing is smooth. In prose, smooth is another word for forgettable.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>The specificity gap - and why invented details feel wrong</h2>

          <p style={p}>Human writers reach for specifics. Not "a major city" but "Cincinnati." Not "a well-known study" but "Kahneman and Tversky's 1979 prospect theory paper." Not "many users reported problems" but "eleven people in our beta flagged the same bug in the first week."</p>

          <p style={p}>These specifics do two things simultaneously. They make the writing credible - they suggest the writer actually knows what they're talking about. And they make it personal - they anchor the content to a real experience rather than a constructed illustration.</p>

          <p style={p}>AI reaches for illustrative generalities because it has no real experiences to draw from. It can invent specifics, but invented specifics have a different texture. They're too clean, too perfectly illustrative, too conveniently on-point. Real specifics are slightly awkward. They don't fit perfectly. A real example has rough edges - it's the right example but maybe not the most elegant one. That imperfect fit is part of what makes it feel true.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>What my colleague was actually sensing</h2>

          <p style={p}>I think what she picked up on - in those thirty seconds - was the cumulative absence of all these things. No rhythm variation. No opinion that shifted mid-paragraph. No specific detail that felt accidentally true. No hedging that was actually earned by genuine uncertainty. No evidence of a person working through something in real time.</p>

          <p style={p}>The writing wasn't wrong. It just wasn't from anywhere. It didn't come from a mind that had spent time with the subject, formed a view, changed that view slightly while writing it down, and then made peace with the imperfect result. Readers, even when they can't articulate it, feel that absence.</p>

          <p style={p}>They read faster and retain less. They don't quote it or send it to someone. It passes through them without leaving a mark. That's the real cost of AI writing used carelessly - not inaccuracy, but a kind of forgettability that well-written human prose doesn't have.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Frequently asked questions</h2>

          {[
            { q: "Can skilled human writers sound 'AI-like' even without using AI?", a: "Yes - particularly in formal registers. Academic writers, legal writers, and technical writers often produce text that scores low on behavioral signals because their style is deliberately impersonal and structured. This is a known limitation of behavioral detection." },
            { q: "If AI hedges to avoid being wrong, why is that a bad signal?", a: "Because calibrated uncertainty is different from reflexive uncertainty. A human who genuinely doesn't know something hedges that specific claim. AI hedges regardless of confidence level - and readers pick up on the inconsistency even if they can't name it." },
            { q: "Does editing AI output fix the rhythm problem?", a: "It can, if the editing is deep enough. Superficial edits - fixing word choices, removing filler phrases - usually don't fix metronomic rhythm. You need to actively vary sentence length and paragraph structure, which takes a different kind of attention than copyediting." },
            { q: "What's the most reliable human signal Content Trace looks for?", a: "Cognitive fingerprinting accounts for 16% of the overall score and is the hardest to fake. It includes opinion drift, self-correction, and thinking-out-loud patterns - things that require actually working through a problem while writing, not before." },
            { q: "Is the 'feel' of AI writing changing as models improve?", a: "Yes, meaningfully. Early ChatGPT output was easy to spot. Current frontier models produce much more natural-sounding text. But the behavioral patterns - the absence of genuine opinion drift, the uniformity of rhythm - remain detectable even as surface-level quality improves." },
