          <p style={p}>I've been testing and observing this question for a while now, and I think that answer is honest but incomplete in ways that matter. The nuances are where the actual risk sits, and where a lot of content teams are making expensive mistakes.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>What Google actually penalizes — and what it doesn&apos;t</h2>

          <p style={p}>The Helpful Content system targets content created primarily for search engines rather than people. The signals it looks for: thin coverage, lack of specificity, no demonstrated expertise or experience, no original perspective. These are also — almost definitionally — the characteristics of unedited AI output.</p>

          <p style={p}>That&apos;s where the correlation comes from. It&apos;s not that Google detects AI and downgrades it. It&apos;s that the qualities that make content rank well are exactly the qualities that make AI detection scores go down — and most AI content, without significant human input, lacks them.</p>

          <p style={p}>The distinction matters because it tells you what kind of AI use is actually safe. A piece that started as an AI draft but got genuinely rewritten by someone with relevant experience — where first-hand knowledge, specific sourcing, and an actual point of view were added by a human — should perform fine. A piece that came out of a prompt and went straight to publish, regardless of keyword optimization, is carrying real risk.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>The E-E-A-T gap that AI content can&apos;t close on its own</h2>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Experience — the signal AI fundamentally lacks</h3>

          <p style={p}>Google added the first &quot;E&quot; (Experience) to its quality framework in late 2022, and it&apos;s the most significant addition for understanding AI content risk. Experience refers to first-hand engagement with the subject matter — you&apos;ve used the product, visited the place, tried the approach. AI hasn&apos;t done any of those things.</p>

          <p style={p}>The practical effect is that content demonstrating personal experience tends to contain specific, slightly imperfect details — the thing that didn&apos;t work quite as expected, the workaround you found, the specific date and context. These are the same details that behavioral AI detectors flag as markers of authentic human cognition. The absence of them registers both as low E-E-A-T and as elevated AI probability.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Expertise — present in AI output, but unverifiable</h3>

          <p style={p}>AI can write with apparent expertise on almost any topic. It synthesizes accurately from training data and presents information coherently. What it can&apos;t do is demonstrate verifiable expertise — it can&apos;t be cited, doesn&apos;t have a credential, can&apos;t be cross-referenced with a professional history. The expertise is real in the sense that the information is usually accurate; it&apos;s hollow in the sense that there&apos;s no accountable human behind it who could be wrong and would face consequences for it.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Trustworthiness — the sourcing problem</h3>

          <p style={p}>AI content tends to make claims with confident authority and support them with either no citations or vague gestures at consensus. &quot;Studies show&quot; without a link to any study. &quot;Experts agree&quot; without naming any experts. This isn&apos;t deliberate vagueness — the model genuinely doesn&apos;t have access to specific sources, only patterns from training data.</p>

          <p style={p}>Trustworthiness in the E-E-A-T framework requires that specific, verifiable claims be backed by named, linkable sources. Adding that is editorial work that AI can&apos;t do for itself. When teams publish AI content as-is, this is usually the most obvious gap — and quality raters are specifically trained to flag it.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>What the sites hit hardest actually had in common</h2>

          <p style={p}>The 2024–2025 core and Helpful Content updates were unusually severe for a category of sites that built large content footprints using AI. Looking at the ones that lost significant organic visibility, some patterns stand out.</p>

          <p style={p}>The hardest-hit content covered topics broadly without going deep — the pattern you get when a model is prompted to write &quot;a comprehensive guide to X&quot; without any specific angle or genuine knowledge to draw from. It also lacked sourcing, used hedged language to avoid committing to positions, and included what I&apos;d describe as constructed comprehensiveness: a lot of headings, a lot of coverage, no real specificity underneath.</p>

          <p style={p}>Sites that used AI more surgically — for initial drafts that then went through substantial human editing, or for narrow tasks like structure and formatting — fared significantly better. The differentiator wasn&apos;t the presence of AI; it was the presence of human thinking applied on top of it.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>The question nobody is asking enough</h2>

          <p style={p}>The framing of &quot;does Google penalize AI content&quot; is understandable but slightly backwards. The better question is: does this content demonstrate that a knowledgeable human engaged with the topic? If yes, the medium used to produce it matters less. If no, the problem isn&apos;t that AI was involved — it&apos;s that no one&apos;s judgment is visible in the text, and judgment is what search rewards.</p>

          <p style={p}>Running your content through a behavioral AI detector before publishing won&apos;t guarantee rankings. But a high behavioral signal score is a useful proxy for a content problem worth fixing: the human cognitive engagement that Google&apos;s systems reward isn&apos;t visible in the text. Adding a genuine position, at least one specifically sourced claim, and any detail that only someone with first-hand familiarity would include moves more signals than anything else — for AI detectors and for search quality evaluators both.</p>
