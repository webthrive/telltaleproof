          <p style={p}>Last year I watched a content team publish forty blog posts in a month using AI drafts with minimal editing. Traffic went up for about six weeks - they were hitting the right keywords. Then it flatlined. The posts got clicks, but almost no one read past the first two paragraphs. Time-on-page was terrible. Newsletter signups from that content: essentially zero.</p>

          <p style={p}>That's the pattern I keep seeing. AI content can win on volume and initial discovery. It almost never wins on the thing that actually builds an audience: making someone feel like they just read something worth their time.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Pass 1 - Kill every filler phrase before touching anything else</h2>

          <p style={p}>Before you touch anything substantive, do one pass with a single goal: delete AI filler. These are the phrases that signal carefulness without being careful. The full list is longer than you'd expect, but the core offenders are: "it's important to note," "it's worth mentioning," "in today's rapidly changing landscape," "there are several key factors to consider," "in conclusion," "it goes without saying," and "needless to say" (which is always followed by something the writer felt very much needed saying).</p>

          <p style={p}>Every single one should go. If the sentence needs the filler phrase to make sense, the underlying point wasn't strong enough - which means it either needs to be rewritten or cut entirely. I've never lost a good idea by deleting a filler phrase. I have made a lot of weak ones obvious.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Pass 2 - Read it aloud and break the rhythm</h2>

          <p style={p}>AI drafts read fine silently. Aloud, the problem becomes obvious immediately: everything is the same length. Same sentence rhythm. Same paragraph size. It sounds like a legal disclaimer read by someone who has never had a strong feeling about anything.</p>

          <p style={p}>Read the draft out loud and mark wherever your voice wants to speed up or slow down. Speed up means the sentence is too long - split it. Slow down means the idea needs more room - let it breathe. A three-word sentence after a long one does more rhetorical work than a paragraph of transitions. Use it deliberately.</p>

          <p style={p}>The goal isn't to write short sentences. It's to vary unpredictably. Two long sentences, then one very short one. A medium paragraph, then a single-sentence paragraph. Then back to something long. Human writers do this naturally because they're writing to the pace of their own thinking, which isn't metronomic.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Pass 3 - Replace every illustration with a specific</h2>

          <p style={p}>AI uses illustrative examples: "For instance, a small business might..." "Consider a scenario where..." "Imagine a user who..." These examples are clean and serviceable and completely forgettable. They exist to make a point rather than to tell you something true.</p>

          <p style={p}>Replace them with real specifics - things you actually know. A client you worked with (anonymized if needed). A number you actually looked up from a real source. A situation you actually observed, even briefly. The example doesn't have to be dramatic. It just has to have happened.</p>

          <p style={p}>Readers can feel the difference between an invented illustration and something that actually occurred. I don't fully understand why this is - there's something about the slightly imperfect fit of a real example, the way it doesn't quite slot in as cleanly as a constructed one, that registers as authentic. Invented examples are too helpful. Real ones have a little friction.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Pass 4 - Find the one thing you actually disagree with</h2>

          <p style={p}>This is the step most people skip, and it's the most important one. AI drafts are balanced to a fault. They present multiple perspectives, acknowledge complexity, and decline to take strong positions. Which is fine for a Wikipedia article. It's death for anything meant to be read and remembered.</p>

          <p style={p}>Go through the draft and find the claim you don't fully agree with. Or the framing that feels slightly wrong. Or the conclusion that's technically defensible but not actually what you'd say to a colleague over coffee. Then rewrite that section to reflect what you actually think - including why the more common take misses something real.</p>

          <p style={p}>You don't have to be contrarian for its own sake. But you do have to have a point of view. If you agree with everything in the draft on first read, you haven't read it carefully enough.

          <h2 style={h2s}>Pass 5 - Add one moment of genuine uncertainty</h2>

          <p style={p}>AI writing is confident in a way that should make you suspicious. It never says "I'm not sure about this" or "this surprised me" or "I used to think the opposite and I'm not completely convinced I was wrong." That unbroken confidence is one of the clearest tells - not because confidence is bad, but because real expertise usually comes with a clearer sense of what you don't know.</p>

          <p style={p}>Add one place in the piece where you're honest about a limitation or a genuine doubt. Not performed humility - actual uncertainty about something real. Maybe you don't have good data on part of the claim. Maybe your experience runs counter to the consensus you just cited. Maybe you've seen this work and also seen it fail, and you don't fully understand the difference yet.</p>

          <p style={p}>Readers trust writing more when it admits what it doesn't know. It makes everything else you say more credible, not less. The unearned confidence of AI text is one of the things that makes it feel hollow - not because readers consciously notice it, but because it violates something true about how people actually know things.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>A note on what "genuine" means here</h3>

          <p style={p}>I've seen writers add fake uncertainty as a technique - "Of course, I may be wrong about this" dropped into an argument they're clearly confident in. That's the performed humility I mentioned, and it reads as manipulative rather than trustworthy. The uncertainty has to be real. If every single thing in the draft is actually what you believe and you have no doubts, maybe the draft is covering ground you know too well. That's also useful information.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Pass 6 - Score it, find the weak sections, iterate</h2>

          <p style={p}>Once I've done a full pass with this framework, I run the piece through <a href="https://contenttrace.ai" style={{ color: "var(--accent)", textDecoration: "underline" }}>Content Trace</a>. Not to check whether it'll "pass" some threshold - that's the wrong frame entirely. I use it to see which sections are still scoring low, because those sections tell me where my edit didn't go deep enough.</p>

          <p style={p}>Cognitive Fingerprinting low? I haven't added enough of my own thinking - the piece still sounds like it's presenting information rather than working through it. Emotional Texture low? It's still detached, still describing rather than engaging. Word Choice low? I haven't done the filler-phrase pass thoroughly enough, or I've replaced filler with different filler. Content & Logic low? The examples are still illustrative rather than specific.</p>

          <p style={p}>The scores are a diagnostic, not a verdict. I don't care what the aggregate Human Score is. I care which sections are pulling it down, because those sections point to specific editing work that still needs doing.</p>

          {[
            { q: "How long does this editing process actually take?", a: "For a 1,000-word AI draft, a thorough pass through all six steps usually takes me 45–75 minutes. That's longer than I'd like, but it's also what separates content that builds an audience from content that gets clicks and zero engagement. I've accepted the tradeoff." },
            { q: "Do I need to run every piece through Content Trace?", a: "No - but it's useful when you're not sure if an edit went deep enough, or when a specific section feels off and you can't identify why. The signal breakdowns are genuinely diagnostic once you understand what each section is measuring." },
            { q: "What if I genuinely agree with everything in the AI draft?", a: "Then either the topic is one you know very well and the draft captured your actual views accurately, or you haven't read it critically enough. Try pushing back on the strongest claim in the piece and see if it holds up under pressure. It usually doesn't." },
            { q: "Can I use AI to help with the editing passes?", a: "For the filler phrase and rhythm passes, yes - AI is reasonably good at those mechanical tasks. For the specificity pass and the 'find what you disagree with' step, no. Those require your actual knowledge and opinions, which is exactly what AI can't supply." },
            { q: "Does this process work for all content types?", a: "The framework applies most directly to informational articles, guides, and opinion pieces. For product descriptions, landing page copy, and other commercial formats, some passes (especially the uncertainty step) need to be adapted - but the filler pass and rhythm pass apply everywhere." },
            { q: "What's the most common mistake people make when humanizing AI content?", a: "Stopping after the filler-phrase pass. That pass is the easiest and most satisfying - you can see the word count drop and the sentences get crisper. But it only addresses one of the eight signals Content Trace measures. The deeper passes (opinion, specificity, uncertainty) are where the real work is." },
