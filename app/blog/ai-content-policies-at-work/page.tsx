          <p style={p}>The question content teams were asking in 2023 was &quot;should we allow AI writing tools?&quot; By 2025 that debate was mostly settled — not by policy, but by practice. People started using them, results were mixed, and organizations found themselves needing actual governance rather than a blanket yes or no.</p>

          <p style={p}>What I&apos;ve seen across different teams and industries is that the governance is genuinely hard to get right. The obvious policy moves — disclosure requirements, AI-use logs, output restrictions — tend to create compliance theater rather than actual quality standards. And the teams that figured out something workable arrived at it through a different frame entirely.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>Why process-based policies mostly fail</h2>

          <p style={p}>The most common policy structure I see is: disclose when AI was used, get approval for AI-generated content above a certain length or visibility, log usage in a shared doc or tool. On paper this is reasonable. In practice it creates three problems.</p>

          <p style={p}>First, detection is imperfect. If you&apos;re enforcing an AI disclosure policy and enforcement depends on catching non-disclosure, you&apos;re relying on detection tools that have meaningful false-positive rates for heavy human editing. People who do significant work on top of an AI draft get flagged. People who use AI minimally but strategically don&apos;t. The enforcement mechanism is unreliable, and everyone knows it.</p>

          <p style={p}>Second, the definition of &quot;AI-generated content&quot; is genuinely contested. Does it include using AI to research? To restructure an outline? To suggest a better word? To write a first draft that was then substantially rewritten? Most people using AI tools regularly have done all of these things in a single piece of content, and a disclosure policy that doesn&apos;t answer this question will be applied inconsistently.</p>

          <p style={p}>Third — and this is the one that matters most — disclosure-based policies focus on process rather than output. The thing that actually matters for content quality isn&apos;t whether AI was involved. It&apos;s whether the output demonstrates genuine expertise, specific knowledge, and editorial judgment. A policy that captures the process but says nothing about the output is measuring the wrong thing.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>What output-focused policies actually look like</h2>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Sourcing standards</h3>

          <p style={p}>The most tractable AI governance standard I&apos;ve seen is a sourcing requirement: any specific factual claim requires an attributable, linkable source. Not &quot;research suggests&quot; — a named study, a publication date, a URL. This doesn&apos;t ban AI use at all; it just requires editorial work to verify and attribute what the AI generated. The work that happens as a result is exactly the kind of human engagement that distinguishes high-quality AI-assisted content from the hollow stuff.</p>

          <p style={p}>The secondary benefit is that this standard is content-auditable after the fact. You don&apos;t need to know whether AI was used. You can look at the piece and see whether the claims are sourced. That&apos;s enforceable in a way that &quot;disclose your AI use&quot; isn&apos;t.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>Perspective requirements</h3>

          <p style={p}>Several teams I&apos;ve talked to have implemented a version of what one editor described to me as &quot;the take requirement&quot;: every piece of external content needs to contain at least one genuine position that could be disagreed with. Not a summary of existing views. An actual claim that the author or organization is willing to put their name on.</p>

          <p style={p}>This requirement is extremely difficult to satisfy with unedited AI output, because AI writing systematically avoids positions that could be wrong. It hedges, balances, and presents multiple perspectives. The take requirement forces the editorial judgment that AI can&apos;t supply — and that judgment is, again, auditable in the output.</p>

          <h3 style={h3s}>The mandatory editorial layer</h3>

          <p style={p}>The teams I&apos;d describe as having figured this out treat AI as producing a draft, not content. The draft goes through a mandatory editorial step where a named person — not just a reviewer, but someone accountable for the output — adds the sourcing, adds the position, contributes the first-hand knowledge or experience that only they could provide. The AI draft is not a shortcut around that step; it&apos;s a starting point for it.</p>

          <p style={p}>This is meaningfully different from &quot;have a human review it before publishing.&quot; Review implies checking for errors and approving. The mandatory editorial layer implies contribution — the reviewer leaves a visible trace of their thinking in the content. That distinction is what separates content that performs from content that doesn&apos;t, and it&apos;s also what separates content that reads well from content that just seems adequate.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>How detection fits into this</h2>

          <p style={p}>The most interesting internal use of AI detection I&apos;ve seen isn&apos;t punitive. It&apos;s diagnostic. Teams run content through a detection tool before it goes to final review, not to catch people violating policy, but to flag where the editorial layer is thin. A high behavioral detection score on a piece that went through the mandatory editorial process is a signal that the contribution was insufficient — the sourcing is there but the perspective isn&apos;t, or vice versa.</p>

          <p style={p}>Using detection this way requires looking at the category breakdown rather than the aggregate score. A piece might score 55% overall, but if the behavioral categories — cognitive fingerprinting, opinion signals, self-correction patterns — are high while the statistical categories are low, that tells you something specific: the statistical surface of the text looks human but the thinking underneath doesn&apos;t. That&apos;s a useful diagnostic. An aggregate score isn&apos;t.</p>

          <h2 style={h2s}>The cultural piece nobody wants to talk about</h2>

          <p style={p}>Policy can set standards but it can&apos;t create the thing that actually produces good AI-assisted content: a team that takes seriously the difference between efficiently-produced and genuinely useful. The teams I&apos;ve seen produce consistently good AI-assisted content have a shared understanding that the AI part is easy — it takes five minutes to generate a draft — and the human part is the actual work. The policy reflects that, and so does the culture.</p>

          <p style={p}>The teams that struggle tend to have quietly internalized the opposite assumption: that AI made the content production easy, and the human step is overhead. You can see it in the output. You can also see it in detection scores — not because AI was used, but because the human engagement that makes content worth reading isn&apos;t there.</p>
